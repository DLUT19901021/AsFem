This is **A** **S**imple **F**inite **E**lement **M**ethod program, which is short for ***AsFem***, for the phase-field modeling and multiphysics simulation.

The package is written in C++ and heavily depends on the [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) library for efficient computing and simulation. It is mainly designed for solid mechanics problems and phase-field modeling.
