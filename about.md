# What is it?
This is *A Simple Finite Element Method* program, which is short for **AsFem**, for the phase-field modeling and multiphysics simulation.

# What can it do?
- [x] Solid Mechanics
- [x] CahnHilliard diffusion
- [x] Dendirte growth
- [x] Finite strain materials
- [x] Phase-field fracture model

# How to use it?
In most of the cases, you just need to download or compile the source code to get the executable, then run it via:
```
asfem -i your_input.i
```
